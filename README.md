# What-is-Neuron
The Neuron is a basic building block of Deep Learning algorithms , There is a minute difference between a Perceptron and Neuron, In this repository i would like to show the mechanism of back propagation using three neurons and how exactly the mechanism of gradient descent applied in back propagation changes the weight of the Neuron
